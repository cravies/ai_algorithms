# ai_algorithms
Implementations of common AI algorithms from scratch I did for a graduate class in AI.

Note that to run the algorithms you need to move the corresponding files from the Datasets folder to your current directory

i.e to run the genetic algorithm which expects regression.txt 

``` bash
cp ../Datasets/regression.txt ./ 
python3 genetic_algorithm.py
```
