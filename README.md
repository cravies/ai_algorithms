# ai_algorithms
Implementations of common AI algorithms from scratch.
Includes:

- Decision tree
- Genetic programming for symbolic regression
- Genetic algorithm to optimise Rosenbrock function
- Langtonâ€™s ant simulator
- Multi Layer Perceptron
- Darknet19 for object classification (fruits)
- CNN for digit rotation detection
- Perceptron for linear classification
- Variational auto encoder (MMD & ELBO loss)
- K means clustering
- K nearest neighbours
- Naive bayes 
- Naive bayes variable elimination method

I mostly used numpy. For the complicated neural network models I used pytorch.
I wrote these programs for various classes I am taking in compsci graduate school.

Jupyter notebooks should be self contained.

For .py scripts, to run the algorithms you need to move the corresponding files from the Datasets folder to your current directory

It is very clearn in the main loop in each program which file it expects.

i.e to run the genetic algorithm which expects regression.txt 

``` bash
cp ../Datasets/regression.txt ./ 
python3 genetic_algorithm.py
```
